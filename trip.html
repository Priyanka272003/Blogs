            <h1>I Love to Travel!!</h1>
            <p style = "font-style:arial;font-size : 20px">I love to travel because it takes me out of my comfort zone and I am always learning something new about myself and about that place each day I'm there.‚Äù "For me it's meeting new people and learning about their different way of life - culture, traditions, food. And seeing what makes each place so unique!</p>
            <h2>Why travelling is my hobby?</h2>
            <p style = "font-style:arial;font-size : 20px">Travelling gives me a good opportunity to learn a lot about the history of the country I visit, to see cultural and historical places, to meet people of different nationalities, to learn a lot about their traditions, customs and culture. In other words. I can expand my worldview and my mind.</p>            
            <p style = "font-style:arial;font-size : 20px">Travel takes us out of our comfort zones and inspires us to see, taste and try new things. It constantly challenges us, not only to adapt to and explore new surroundings, but also to engage with different people, to embrace adventures as they come and to share new and meaningful experiences with friends and loved ones.
